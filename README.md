# Ch-19-Web-App

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

I run the npm run start from the terminal, to test this locally run npm start from the terminal and check for errors before deploying to Heroku
 The application should start up the backend and serve the client
 To deploy to Heroku git add -A, git commit -m "pushing to Heroku", git push from the terminal
 you will see the application 
 Technologies used are JavaScript, webpack plugins, registered a service worker and deployed to Heroku
 Some of the challenges I faced with this project was; Difficulties deploying to Heroku due to syntax errors, package.json wasn't setup correctly which caused the build to fail, Failed to load '/tmp/build_a932e3b9/client/webpack.config.js'
 I was able to colab with some very key people to get a successful build: AskBCS Group and Emma 
 Hope you enjoy my notes editor....
